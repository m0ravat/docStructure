# Software Methodology

## 1. Introduction
This project follows the **[Methodology Name]** approach, which was chosen due to its suitability for **[reasons, e.g., flexibility, efficiency, scalability]**. This methodology ensures that development remains **[key benefits, e.g., iterative, adaptive, well-documented]**, aligning with the project's goals.

## 2. Development Lifecycle
The development process is divided into several key phases:

- **Planning**: Defining requirements, setting goals, and outlining key milestones.
- **Development**: Writing code, implementing features, and ensuring adherence to coding standards.
- **Testing**: Performing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to validate functionality.
- **Deployment**: Releasing updates to the appropriate environment (e.g., Staging, Production).
- **Maintenance**: Monitoring, bug fixing, and continuous improvements based on feedback.

Each phase follows a structured workflow to maintain efficiency and consistency.

## 3. Project Management & Workflow
- **Task Tracking**: Issues and tasks are managed using **[tool, e.g., Jira, Trello, GitHub Projects]**, with clear assignments and deadlines.
- **Collaboration**: Team members communicate via **[e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams]**, and conduct regular meetings such as **[stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives]**.
- **Workflow**:
  1. A task is created and assigned.
  2. Development work begins, following coding standards and guidelines.
  3. Code is reviewed and tested before merging.
  4. The task is marked complete once deployed and verified.

This structured approach ensures clarity, accountability, and smooth development cycles.
