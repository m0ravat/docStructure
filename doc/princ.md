# Coding Standards & Principles

## SOLID Principles 

### Single Responsibility Principle

Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:
> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job

### Open Closed Principle

Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:  
> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.

### Liskov Substitution Principle:

Liskov Substitution Principle states:
> Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of
type S where S is a subtype of T.

This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

### Interface Segregation Principle

The interface segregation principle states:
> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on
 methods they do not use.


### Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency inversion principle states:
> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they
should depend on abstractions.
